# Loan Prediction AI Project

This project applies machine learning to the challenge of loan approval prediction.  
The goal is to explore how different models can process financial and business-related data to support decision-making.  

We worked with three models: **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forest**.  
Each model provided unique perspectives, but **Random Forest** proved to be the most reliable in handling the complexity of the data.  

The project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to analyze loan applications, compare modeling techniques, and build a foundation for fair and data-driven financial decisions.
